## Run and Build

### Environment

 - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 - Change to the folder `./`, run `npm install` to install dependented libraries
 - Change to the folder `./app`, run `npm install` again

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd app && npm install && cd ..
    ```

### Build and run

 - Change to the folder `./`, run `npm run dll` to build common files
 - Change to the folder `./`, run `npm run build`
 - Change to the folder `./`, run `npm start`, the App should start

    ```bash
    # create dll file
    npm run dll
 
    # build
    npm run build

    # start
    npm start

    # or start in developer mode
    npm run dev
    ```

### Package

 - It is recommended to use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) for packaging.
 - Go to the `./` folder, run `npm run make` . The packaged files will be in the `./dist` folder.
 - This command may take several minutes to finish when you run it the first time, as it needs time to download dependent files. You can download the dependencies manually [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases), or [Taobao mirror](https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/electron/), then save the files to `~/.electron`. You can check the [Electron Docs](http://electron.atom.io/docs/) for more infomation.

    ```bash
    # pack
    npm run make # the packed files will be in ./dist

    # or 
    npm run build-and-make
    ```
